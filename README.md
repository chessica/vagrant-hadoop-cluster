Deploying hadoop in a virtualized cluster in simple steps

These are the files that support the blogpost http://cscarioni.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/setting-up-hadoop-virtual-cluster-with.html

Maybe generate your own ssh-keygen pair of keys.. and replace them in the files id_rsa and id_rsa.pub in the modules/hadoop/files directory. Or for testing copy the provided `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub` into your `.ssh` directory.
